## 7. Garanti VPOS

- **Explanation**: Initially, it was known that the customer wanted Garanti VPOS integration, but no credentials or detailed requirements were provided. Later, the development team received documentation for VakıfBank VPOS instead, with no indication that both systems would be required. This led to the assumption that the customer had decided to proceed with only VakıfBank VPOS. After the implementation of VakıfBank VPOS was completed, the customer requested Garanti VPOS integration as well, but at that point, it was too late to implement it within the current scope.

## 8. Plane Ticket Insurance

- **Explanation**: An API was provided afterwards. It was initially planned to be applied based on an internal algorithm. However, since the API required a 2D payment step as well, the development team decided to park it for now.
